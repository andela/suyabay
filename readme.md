[SuyaBay](https://www.suyabay.com) is a podcasting app built for suya lovers. Users can use the app either as a **guest** or a **registered user**. Being a registered user means a user has access to features such as **social integration features** (liking and sharing favorite episodes), which is not available to a guest user. A guest user can only have access to general episodes if available.
